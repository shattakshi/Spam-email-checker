# 🧠 Spam Email Checker

A beginner-friendly Python project that checks if an email message is likely to be spam by scanning for common spam keywords.

🚀 This project was built to practice basic Python concepts like:
- Lists
- Loops
- String methods
- Conditional logic

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Practice basic Python concepts (lists, loops, strings, input/output)
- Understand how simple rule-based spam detection works
- Build a beginner-friendly project to add to GitHub and resume

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. A list of common spam keywords is defined.
2. The program takes user input as an email message.
3. It converts the message to lowercase for consistent matching.
4. It checks how many spam words are found in the message.
5. If more than 2 spam words are found, the email is flagged as spam.
